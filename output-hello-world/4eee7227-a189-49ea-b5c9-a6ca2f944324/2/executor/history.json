The solution could provide more specific recommendations for fixing the issue (e.g., add `preexec_fn=os.setsid` parameter)\\n2. Should include information about how SIGINT signals might not reach child processes in the current implementation\\n3. Could reference Python multiprocessing best practices for signal handling\\n\\n**Scoring Justification:**\\nScore 0.6 (Partial verification) because:\\n- The solution correctly identifies the core issue (missing proper signal handling in subprocess creation)\\n- Evidence is accurate and verifiable\\n- However, the solution's test for interrupt method logic was partially incorrect upon manual verification\\n- More comprehensive verification could be done with actual process signal handling tests\"}}",
