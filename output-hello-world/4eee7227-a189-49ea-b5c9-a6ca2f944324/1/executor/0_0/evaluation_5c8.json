    "raw_response": "Score: 0.7\nFeedback: I actively verified the solution by examining the actual code and testing signal handling functionality. The solution is a diagnostic analysis claiming \"incomplete or inconsistent SIGINT (Ctrl+C) signal handling.\" My verification reveals:\n\n**Verification Results:**\n1. ✅ Signal handler registration exists (lines 455-459) for both SIGINT and SIGTERM\n2. ✅ KeyboardInterrupt exception handling exists (line 486) \n3. ✅ Signal handler function properly defined (lines 443-453)\n4. ✅ Basic signal handling test passed - signal handlers can be registered\n5. ✅ Windows compatibility considered (NotImplementedError catch at line 458)\n\n**Issues Found:**\n1. **Contradictory evidence weights**: The solution gives \"High\" weight to both NecessarySign (signal handler exists) AND ContraIndicator (no signal handling code), when they contradict each other. The ContraIndicator should have result 0 since evidence was found.\n2. **Incomplete analysis**: The solution claims \"Multiple signal handlers registered\" as a ConfirmingSign (result 0.8), but the code shows standard single handler registration for two signals, which is normal practice.\n3. **Lack of actual testing**: The solution doesn't demonstrate whether the signal handling actually works end-to-end (e.g., testing graceful shutdown).\n4. **Misleading assumption**: The assumption states \"fails to trigger proper shutdown sequences\" but provides no evidence this actually happens.\n\n**Improvement Suggestions:**\n1. Fix logical inconsistencies in evidence scoring\n2. Actually test signal handling by running the agent and sending SIGINT\n3. Provide concrete evidence of any actual shutdown sequence failures\n4. Clarify what \"proper shutdown sequence\" means in this context\n5. Remove contradictory evidence that doesn't match the codebase reality\n\n**Conclusion:** The solution has partial validity (signal handling code exists) but contains logical flaws and lacks concrete verification of the claimed problem. The objective (identifying signal handling issues) is partially addressed but with significant analytical weaknesses."
