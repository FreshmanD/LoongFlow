The verification included:\\n\\n1. **Structural Validation**: Tested the solution's structure with 6 out of 7 tests passing (86% score), confirming proper formatting, evidence organization, and logical flow.\\n\\n2. **Code Analysis Verification**:\\n   - Found **2 instances** of `multiprocessing.Process` creation without proper signal handling parameters (`preexec_fn` or `start_new_session`)\\n   - Verified the exact lines in evaluator.py (lines 229 and 488) where processes are created without these parameters\\n   - Confirmed that default `multiprocessing.Process` behavior does not set up new session or process groups\\n\\n3. **Evidence Validation**:\\n   - Confirmed 2 out of 3 evidence files exist and contain relevant code\\n   - Found that `/Users/daixunan/baidu/agent/LoongFlow/src/loongflow/agentsdk/base_agent.py` does not exist, which slightly impacts evidence completeness\\n\\n4. **Solution Accuracy Assessment**:\\n   - The solution correctly identifies that process group management can cause inconsistent SIGINT propagation\\n   - The claim about timing dependencies affecting signal delivery is plausible given the code analysis\\n   - The evidence structure (NecessarySign, ConfirmingSign, ContraIndicator) is appropriate for the problem domain\\n\\n**Key Findings**:\\n- \\u2705 **Objective achieved**: Solution correctly identifies real code issues related to process group management\\n- \\u2705 **Technical correctness**: Verified through direct code analysis showing missing signal handling parameters\\n- \\u2705 **Evidence-based**: Solution uses appropriate evidence types and file references\\n- \\u26a0\\ufe0f **Minor issue**: One evidence file listed does not exist, but doesn't invalidate the core analysis\\n\\n**Verification Methods Used**:\\n1. Structural tests to validate solution format\\n2. AST-based code analysis to find `multiprocessing.Process` calls\\n3. Parameter analysis to check for `preexec_fn` and `start_new_session`\\n4. File existence verification for evidence references\\n\\n**Improvement Suggestions**:\\n1. Update evidence file list to remove non-existent `/Users/daixunan/baidu/agent/LoongFlow/src/loongflow/agentsdk/base_agent.py`\\n2. Consider adding specific line numbers for process creation evidence\\n3. Could suggest concrete fixes (e.g., adding `start_new_session=True` to process creation)\\n\\nThe solution successfully meets its objective of identifying process group management issues that could cause inconsistent SIGINT propagation, with strong evidence from actual code verification.\"}}",
