    "raw_response": "Score: 0.8\nFeedback: Based on active verification through test execution and code analysis, the solution is nearly complete but has minor gaps:\n\n## Verification Results:\n\n### 1. Test Execution (5/5 tests passed):\n- ✅ Signal handlers are registered for SIGINT and SIGTERM\n- ✅ Signal handler implementation is non-blocking\n- ✅ Windows fallback works correctly  \n- ✅ KeyboardInterrupt exception is properly handled\n- ✅ Signal handler correctly uses async operations\n\n### 2. Code Analysis:\n- Signal registration at lines 455-460 correctly handles both SIGINT and SIGTERM\n- Signal handler (lines 446-460) is non-blocking: uses `agent._stop_event.set()` and `asyncio.create_task()`\n- KeyboardInterrupt exception handler exists at lines 486-487\n- Windows fallback implemented with `NotImplementedError` catch\n\n### 3. Issues Found:\n1. **Lack of Comprehensive Integration Test**: The tests verify individual components but don't test the actual signal handling in a running process\n2. **No Verification of Actual CTRL+C Behavior**: The solution doesn't demonstrate whether CTRL+C actually works in practice\n3. **Runtime Verification Missing**: Should test signal handling during actual agent execution\n\n### 4. Suggested Improvements:\n1. Create integration test that starts a mock agent and sends SIGINT\n2. Add test to verify `agent.interrupt()` is called when signal received\n3. Test that `agent._stop_event.set()` actually stops the agent\n4. Test cleanup behavior after signal reception\n\n## Conclusion:\nThe solution correctly identifies that signal handling functions exist and are properly registered, and the implementation is non-blocking. However, without testing the actual CTRL+C behavior in a running process, we cannot fully confirm the problem is resolved. The analysis is comprehensive but verification is incomplete."
